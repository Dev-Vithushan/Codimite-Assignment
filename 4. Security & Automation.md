### **1. Sample Conftest Policy for Terraform**

Below is a sample Conftest policy written in Rego to ensure that all Terraform configurations include encryption for GCS buckets and restrict the project.

#### **Policy File (`gcs_policy.rego`)**

```rego
package main

# Ensure GCS buckets are encrypted
deny[msg] {
  input.resource.type == "google_storage_bucket"
  not input.resource.values.encryption.default_kms_key_name
  msg := sprintf("GCS bucket '%s' must include encryption with a KMS key.", [input.resource.name])
}

# Ensure GCS buckets are in a restricted project
deny[msg] {
  input.resource.type == "google_storage_bucket"
  input.resource.values.project != "restricted-project-id"
  msg := sprintf("GCS bucket '%s' must belong to the restricted project 'restricted-project-id'.", [input.resource.name])
}
```

### **2. Trivy Command to Scan Docker Images**

Use the following command to integrate Trivy in a GitHub Actions pipeline:

#### **Trivy Command**
```bash
trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity CRITICAL,HIGH gcr.io/my-project/my-image:latest
```

- `--exit-code 1`: Ensures the pipeline fails if vulnerabilities are found.
- `--severity CRITICAL,HIGH`: Scans for critical and high-severity vulnerabilities only.
- `gcr.io/my-project/my-image:latest`: Specifies the Docker image to be scanned.

### **GitHub Actions Workflow Snippets**

#### **1. Run Conftest for Terraform Policy Enforcement**
```yaml
jobs:
  policy-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Conftest
        run: |
          curl -L https://github.com/open-policy-agent/conftest/releases/download/v0.38.0/conftest_0.38.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar zx
          sudo mv conftest /usr/local/bin/

      - name: Run Conftest
        run: |
          conftest test main.tf -p policies
```

#### **2. Trivy Image Scan**
```yaml
jobs:
  image-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Trivy
        run: |
          curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/trivy/main/contrib/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

      - name: Scan Docker Image
        run: |
          trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity CRITICAL,HIGH gcr.io/my-project/my-image:latest
```

### **Key Points**
- **Conftest**: Validates Terraform code for compliance before applying it. Policies are defined in Rego.
- **Trivy**: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities and integrates seamlessly with CI pipelines.
- **Automation**: These tools ensure infrastructure and application security as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
